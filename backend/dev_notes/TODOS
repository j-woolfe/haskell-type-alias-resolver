Alias names without capital letters break everything

Default to human readable, change to `raw` output

Enable optional PORT for --server

Change command name to htar or something

Improve human readable output

Interactive mode? Repl based on server mode?

Enable multiple targets in single request

Test with --release and see if optimisations are needed

Break target type into subtypes and run for each of them


Broken test
(Int, String) shouldn't match 
    type G3Tuple a b c = (a, b, c)
    type G3TupleMatching a b = (a, b, a)

Running `target/debug/htar -r -p tests/input_files/generic.hs -t '(Int, String)'`
Target type: (Int, String)
Matched:
        G2Tuple Int String
        G3Tuple Int String c
        G3TupleMatching Int String



Maybe shouldn't match
    type GTag a = a
    type GMaybe a = Maybe a

Running `target/debug/htar -r -p tests/input_files/generic.hs -t Maybe`
Target type: Maybe
